        js: "<p>JavaScript is where the fun begins! I began learning vanilla JS with both Codecademy and FreeCodeCamp and have since completed both courses. FCC's algorithm challenges were very helpful because they taught me how do my own research and code with others.</p><p>I have also completed a couple of ReactJS courses and began building some FCC projects. This has been one of my favorite JS libraries so far.</p> <a href='https://www.freecodecamp.org/nikkilr88' target='_blank'>Have a look at some of the algorithm challenges I have completed</a>",
    
        backend: "<p>This has been my favorite so far. I began learning Node.js and MongoDB in an online bootcamp, which I am still currently working though. I made a basic blog and movie search app, which taught me about RESTful routing, how to access data from APIs and how to use Mongoose.</p><p>I am excited to continue with the bootcamp and improve on my skills that I have already learned.</p>"
